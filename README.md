# Ps Command Palette

> [!WARNING]
> This project is experimental and under active development.

Boost your Adobe Photoshop efficiency with quick access to most **Menu Commands**, **Tools**, and **more**.

> [!TIP]
> I have a similar ExtendScript/ScriptUI based project for Adobe Illustrator called [Ai Command Palette](https://github.com/joshbduncan/AiCommandPalette).

## To-dos

- [ ] load other command types (tools, actions, custom, etc.)
- [ ] save query history
- [ ] implement fuzzy filter for querybox (with history scoring)
- [ ] capture keyboard shortcut combinations in modal (not looking good)
- [ ] remove/hide <sp-menu-item> selected checkmark
- [ ] figure out workflows
